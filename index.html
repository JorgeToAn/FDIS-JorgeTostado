    <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
        <p>Here you will find some info about me</p>
    <h2>Basic info about me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jorge Tostado and I was born on September 24th, 2000 in the city of Mexicali in Baja California, Mexico and currently still is the place where I live.
            Right now I'm studying at the Technological Institute of Mexicali (ITM), specifically, on computer systems engineering.
            I'm actually a very tall person at 190cm (6'3") and pretty skinny as well, I consider myself more of an introvert but I don't shut myself off completely from other people, just a little awkward to talk to complete strangers.</p>
